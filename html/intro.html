<p>
    This script helps you to reconfigure your DokuWiki to a state that should allow you to login again and manually
    fix things.
</p>

<p>This script has two steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Check Requirements</li>
    <li>Reset DokuWiki</li>
</ol>

<p>
    None of the steps will touch your actual data (pages, media) so you don't need to worry.
</p>

<p>
    Using the script happens on your risk. Please keep in mind that this script will <b>not</b> work for you…
</p>

<ul>
    <li>…when certain files are not writable (the script will tell you about it)</li>
    <li>…when you moved your <code>conf</code> directory to a different place (the script might think it succeeded, but
        it will still not work for you)
    </li>
    <li>…when your PHP doesn't work at all (you will see some message further up)</li>
    <li>…when the requirements to run DokuWiki aren't met (Step 1 will help you with that)</li>
</ul>
