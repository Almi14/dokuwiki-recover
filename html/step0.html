<h1>DokuWiki Problems, eh?</h1>
<p>
    This script helps you to reconfigure your DokuWiki to a state that should allow you to login again and manually
    fix things.

    <b>Important:</b> Having this script on your server is a security risk. Be sure to <a href="?step=delete">remove</a>
    it as soon as you're done with it.

<p>This script has two steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Check Requirements</li>
    <li>Reset DokuWiki</li>
</ol>

<p>
    None of the steps will touch your actual data (pages, media) so you don't need to worry.
</p>

<p>
    Using the script happens on your own risk. Please keep in mind that this script will <b>not</b> work for you when…
</p>

<ul>
    <li>…certain files are not writable (the script will tell you about it)</li>
    <li>…you moved your <code>conf</code> directory to a different place (the script might think it succeeded, but
        it will still not work for you)
    </li>
    <li>…your PHP doesn't work at all (you will see some message further up)</li>
    <li>…the requirements to run DokuWiki aren't met (Step 1 will help you with that)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The next step will simply check if your PHP setup matches all the requirments of the newest DokuWiki release.
    Maybe your setup is simply missing a little something? That step will not modify anything, it just checks things
    so its perfectly save to click that button :-).
